# VPS Setup Guide

Welcome to VPS setup guide. A complete step-by-step guide to setup a new or existing VPS

## Introduction

A VPS, or Virtual Private Server, is a virtualized server environment hosted on a physical server, providing dedicated resources and greater control than shared hosting. It simulates a dedicated server experience by partitioning a physical server into multiple isolated virtual instances. Each VPS runs its own operating system and applications, offering more flexibility and performance than shared hosting.

### SSH Login

SSH will give you easy access to your VPS. After executing this command in the PowerShell it will ask you if you want to want to save the fingerprint of your VPS into your PC. 'Yes' will save a SSH key into known_hosts file into C:\Users\your_user_name\.ssh folder.

```shell
ssh root@your_vps_ip_address
```
